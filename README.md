# Client-Server-Hangman

Program is in Python3. To play, run the server first and then the client.
Typing “\q” on the client will only close the client, to close both, type “/q” in the server.
The game is two-person, so both the server and the client participate by guessing letters. However, the hangman game is instantiated in the server and only runs there. The game is case-sensitive and both uppercase and lowercase letters can be used.
